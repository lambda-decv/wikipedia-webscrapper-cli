# Wikipedia WebScrapper CLI

This project is just a practrice project

If you want to try to redo a similar project, the goal is **get the summary of wikipedia pages**, for the project you have just to use *Puppeteer* and *QOA* but you can use other module for example I have used *readline* instead QOA. <br/><br/>
If you want to give me feedaback, send me a mail (if it possible send mail with "wikipedia-webscrapper-cli" in subject)
